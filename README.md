# Android Developer Nanodegree - Popular Movies, Stage 1

This is the project implementation for the Android Developer Nanodegree,
writing a first step towards a movie application using the API
from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org).

## Prerequisites

The application has been built using Android Studio 2.3.3 which was the
current stable version of Android Studio at the time of development.

It uses some dependencies:
```
picasso
okhttp
icepick
retrofit
moshi
```

The min-SDK level has been taken from the suggestion provided by
Android Studio.

Since the application uses the [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org)
API it is necessary to have a valid developer key.
This key can either be overwritten in the file `gradle.properties`, or it can
be set in the file `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` (user specific gradle
properties).
